- 👋 Hi, I’m @whitbeeshinin
- 👀 I’m interested in all things tech really, but especially climate/green tech and health care tech.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to hone my skills in full stack development. I'm working on several projects at the moment; a personal website, an application that allows users access to a database of biodynamic wines, and a symptom tracker app that will allow users suffering from a chronic illness to track their symptoms, food intake, and more so they can better understand potential symptom triggers.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything! I am especially intrigued by climate/green tech, and health and fitness-related products.
- 📫 How to reach me: w.fordfit@gmail.com is best.
